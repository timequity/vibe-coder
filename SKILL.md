# Vibe Coder

Describe what you want. Get a deployed product.

## The Vibe

```
You: "I want an app for tracking expenses"
     ↓
Claude: Asks a few questions
     ↓
Claude: Builds everything (hidden complexity)
     ↓
You: ✅ Done! [Preview] [Deploy]
```

## What's Included

### MVP Workflow (unique to Vibe Coder)
| Skill | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| `brainstorming` | Refine ideas with Socratic dialogue |
| `idea-validation` | Validate problem/solution fit |
| `stack-selector` | Choose tech stack automatically |
| `ui-generator` | Create UI from descriptions |
| `feature-builder` | Add features incrementally |
| `db-designer` | Design database schema |
| `api-generator` | Generate API endpoints |
| `deploy-automation` | Deploy to production |

### All Craft Coder Skills (40+)
- **Backend**: Python, Node.js, Rust

- **Mobile**: React Native, Expo
- **Data**: Pipelines, dbt, Airflow
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, K8s, monitoring
- **Quality**: Testing, code review, debugging

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/vibe:brainstorm` | Refine idea with Socratic dialogue |
| `/vibe:idea` | Start from scratch with simple questions |
| `/vibe:build` | Create the app (full pipeline) |
| `/vibe:add` | Add feature to existing app |
| `/vibe:preview` | Show current state |
| `/vibe:deploy` | Publish to production |

## Agents

- **vibe-coder** — Build apps from descriptions
- **code-reviewer** — Review code automatically

## Hidden Pipeline

Every change runs through:
1. TDD (test first, then implement)
2. Automated tests
3. Security checks (OWASP)
4. Code review (auto-fix issues)

User only sees ✅ or ❌ — never the process.

## Templates

| Template | When to use |
|----------|-------------|
| nextjs-supabase | Web apps, SaaS, dashboards |
| fastapi-postgres | APIs, backends, AI/ML projects |
| hono-drizzle | Edge, serverless, Cloudflare |
| landing-page | Marketing sites, portfolios |

Stack selector chooses automatically.

## No Technical Jargon

You never need to know:
- What framework to use
- How to structure code
- What tests to write
- How to deploy

Just describe what you want. Vibe coding at its finest.
