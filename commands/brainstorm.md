description: Refine your idea through Socratic dialogue
---

Use the brainstorming skill to help refine this idea through collaborative questioning.

Ask one question at a time. Prefer multiple choice when possible. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs. YAGNI ruthlessly.

After understanding the idea, present the design in sections of 200-300 words, checking after each section if it looks right.
