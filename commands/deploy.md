description: Deploy your app to production
---

Use the deploy-automation skill to publish the app.

Process:
1. Run pre-deploy checks (tests, security)
2. Select platform based on template
3. Configure environment variables
4. Deploy to production
5. Return production URL

User says: "Deploy" or "Publish" or "Go live"
You respond: "Deploying to [platform]..." → "✅ Live at https://your-app.vercel.app"

If checks fail, explain simply and offer to fix.
