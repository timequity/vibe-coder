description: Build the complete app from validated idea

Run the full MVP build pipeline:

1. Use stack-selector to choose the right template (don't ask user)
2. Generate project structure from template
3. Create initial UI with ui-generator
4. Apply theme from theme-factory
5. Run TDD cycle with test-driven-development
6. Validate with auto-testing, security-check, code-review-auto
7. Start dev server for preview

Show progress: "Setting up..." → "Creating UI..." → "Testing..." → "✅ Ready!"

Hide all technical details. User sees only progress and final preview URL.
