description: Add a feature to your app
---

Use the feature-builder skill to add the requested feature.

Process:
1. Understand what feature is needed
2. Generate code with TDD (test first)
3. Run validation pipeline (tests, security, review)
4. Update preview

Common features: auth, payments, search, CRUD, notifications

User says: "Add [feature]"
You respond: "Adding [feature]..." → "✅ [Feature] added. Check preview."

Never show code unless asked. Just confirm it works.
