# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work

## The Four Phases

Complete each phase before proceeding to the next.

### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**
   - Don't skip past errors or warnings
   - Read stack traces completely
   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

2. **Reproduce Consistently**
   - Can you trigger it reliably?
   - What are the exact steps?
   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess

3. **Check Recent Changes**
   - Git diff, recent commits
   - New dependencies, config changes
   - Environmental differences

4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**

   ```
   For EACH component boundary:
     - Log what data enters component
     - Log what data exits component
     - Verify environment/config propagation

   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
   THEN investigate that specific component
   ```

5. **Trace Data Flow**

   - Where does bad value originate?
   - What called this with bad value?
   - Keep tracing up until you find the source
   - Fix at source, not at symptom

   **SUB-SKILL:** Use root-cause-tracing for backward tracing technique

### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

1. **Find Working Examples**
   - Locate similar working code in same codebase
   - What works that's similar to what's broken?

2. **Compare Against References**
   - Read reference implementation COMPLETELY
   - Don't skim - read every line

3. **Identify Differences**
   - What's different between working and broken?
   - List every difference, however small

4. **Understand Dependencies**
   - What other components does this need?
   - What settings, config, environment?

### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

1. **Form Single Hypothesis**
   - State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
   - Be specific, not vague

2. **Test Minimally**
   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
   - One variable at a time
   - Don't fix multiple things at once

3. **Verify Before Continuing**
   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4
   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
   - DON'T add more fixes on top

### Phase 4: Implementation

1. **Create Failing Test Case**
   - Simplest possible reproduction
   - Automated test if possible
   - **SUB-SKILL:** Use test-driven-development

2. **Implement Single Fix**
   - Address the root cause identified
   - ONE change at a time
   - No "while I'm here" improvements

3. **Verify Fix**
   - Test passes now?
   - No other tests broken?

4. **If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture**
   - Each fix reveals new problem in different place?
   - Fixes require "massive refactoring"?
   - **STOP and discuss with user before attempting more fixes**

## Red Flags - STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or rejected |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## Integration

**Required sub-skills:**
- **root-cause-tracing** - When error is deep in call stack
- **test-driven-development** - For creating failing test case

**Complementary skills:**
- **defense-in-depth** - Add validation at multiple layers
- **condition-based-waiting** - Replace arbitrary timeouts
- **verification-before-completion** - Verify fix before claiming success
